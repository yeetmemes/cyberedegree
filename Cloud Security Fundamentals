LAMP is a very common example of a web service stack, named as an acronym of the names of its original four open-source components: the Linux operating system, the Apache HTTP Server, the MySQL relational database management system, and the PHP programming language.

LAMP deployment steps in azure
• Deploy a Virtual Machine on a Managed Disk with your preferred Linux OS distribution.
• Install Apache, your preferred PHP version and other stuff you consider.
• Deallocate and generalize the Virtual Machine.
• Capture the Virtual Machine Disk Image to generate the custom golden image.
• Deploy the networking resources (load balancer, etc).
• Deploy the Azure Cache for Redis.
• Deploy the Azure Database for MySQL.
• Create the Azure Storage account and container.
• Create your Virtual Machine Scale Set ensuring it references the captured Disk Image as the OS Disk.
• Enable protection against DDoS attacks.

Here are the steps to put security infrastructure in place for LAMP stack in Azure:

• Define Security Requirements: Identify the security requirements that are specific to your LAMP stack deployment. This may include things like network security, data encryption, access control, and more.
• Configure Network Security: Ensure that your LAMP stack is configured to only accept traffic from trusted sources. This can be done by configuring Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) to restrict traffic to only the necessary ports and protocols.
• Implement SSL/TLS: Enable SSL/TLS encryption on your LAMP stack to ensure that all data in transit is encrypted. You can use Azure Key Vault to manage and securely store SSL/TLS certificates.
• Set Up Access Control: Implement access control measures to restrict access to your LAMP stack to only authorized users. This can be done by setting up Azure Active Directory and using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to manage user access.
• Implement Monitoring and Logging: Set up monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents in real-time. Azure Security Center can help you monitor your LAMP stack for security threats.
• Regularly Update and Patch: Keep your LAMP stack up-to-date with the latest security updates and patches. Azure Update Management can help you automate the process of updating and patching your LAMP stack.
• Perform Penetration Testing: Regularly perform penetration testing to identify any vulnerabilities in your LAMP stack. You can use Azure Security Center to perform automated vulnerability assessments.
• Backup and Disaster Recovery: Set up backup and disaster recovery measures to ensure that your LAMP stack can be quickly restored in case of a security incident or disaster. Azure Site Recovery can help you implement disaster recovery for your LAMP stack.

By following these steps, you can put in place a comprehensive security infrastructure for your LAMP stack deployment in Azure.
